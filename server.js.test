Everything in this file is all you would need in order to boot up the terminal
and start listening to the port

Our server is live, but it doesn't really do anything with everything that is listed below

so what is it that we need in order to have a fully functional server?

we set express to a variable, we set mongoclient to variable in order to interact with the database,
and we call body parser to a variable.

we are also calling an express function to a variable, and also setting the port and set it up to listen

=====================================================================
// server.js

//we are initializing our app as an instance of express, the framework
const express = require('express');

//we are using mongoclient in order to interact with the database
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;

const bodyParser = require('body-parser');


const app = express();

//this is setting our port
const port = 2200;
//this makes it so the app is listening to the port
app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log('we are live on port: ' + port);
});
